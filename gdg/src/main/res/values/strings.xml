    <string name="welcome_message">Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are
    interested in Google\'s Developer Technology\; Everything from Android, Chrome, Drive, and Google
        Cloud Platforms to Product API, Maps API, and Youtube API.\n\n\n
        A GDG can take many forms —from just a few people getting together to watch Google\'s Latest
        Videos,to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons.
        However at the core GDGs are focused on developers and technical contents, and the core audience should be developers.
